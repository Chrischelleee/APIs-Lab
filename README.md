# APIs Lab! 

## Introduction

  APIs are a powerful way for us to use publicly available datasets to enhance the functionality of our apps! The goal of this lab is for you to practice researching and using an API with which you are unfamilar, and use it to create an app!
  
## Instructions

Choose one of the APIs below. Use the endpoint and documentation to create an app! 

## Github

  Use the Github API to search for an individual user, and output their name, picture, and username to the screen. 

  #### Sample Endpoint

    https://api.github.com/users/twant

  #### Documentation

    https://developer.github.com/v3/users/

  #### Bonus

    Output the number of repositories, and make their picture link to their Github profile page
  
    Use Materialize to style the page
  
## Makeup 

  Use the Makeup API to search for all of the products from a particular brand. Output the picture, name, and price of the first product returned by the API.

  #### Sample Endpoint

    http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/api/v1/products.json?brand=maybelline

  #### Documentation

    http://makeup-api.herokuapp.com/

  #### Bonus

    Figure out how to search by brand and product type (so that it would only return mascaras by Maybelline, for example). You could use this idea to search by as many of the parameters listed in the documentation as you would like. 
  
    Use iteration to output information about all of the products returned by the API.
  
    Style the page using Materialize
